Project: On-Street Illegal Parking Detection and Warning Using AI Cam

This project aims to address the problem of illegal parking in school areas. By utilizing an AI camera, it detects vehicles parked in prohibited zones and warns drivers through a visual and audible alert system. The system employs a DFRobot Huskylens AI camera, an ESP32 microcontroller, and Arduino Cloud to achieve its goals.

The system consists of two primary components: a Smart AI Camera Pole and a Smart Warning Sign Pole. The camera pole detects violations and reports them to the cloud, while the warning pole activates alerts based on the received commands. Future improvements include enhancing the alert system and integrating solar power for sustainability.
